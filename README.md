## Overview

This project served as a playground for honing my skills in REST API development and mastering state handling in React.js. Let's dive into how I strategically utilized each technology:

## Technologies in Action

### Frontend

- **React.js with TypeScript**: Dynamically powering the frontend UI while enjoying the benefits of static typing for code reliability.

- **React Router**: Seamlessly navigating through the application with declarative routing for a smooth user experience.

- **Tailwind CSS**: Styling made easy with a utility-first CSS framework, bringing visual appeal to the project effortlessly.

### Backend

- **Node.js and Express.js**: Driving the backend with the V8 engine and utilizing Express.js for building robust APIs.

- **MySQL**: Efficiently storing and retrieving data with this relational database, forming the backbone of our backend.
